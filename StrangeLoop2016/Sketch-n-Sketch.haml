%h2 Sketch-n-Sketch: Interactive SVG Programming with Direct Manipulation
%i Ravi Chugh
%p Direct manipulation systems are like Adobe Illustrator. They are cool for making a static image, but for animations, it gets tricky.
%p So, let's program! But that is yucky, because you have to abstract your graphics out to text in code. That is hard to map without testing to see what is going on.
%p The code is great and useful, but the initial design sucked. Where getting off the ground with direct manipulation is easy, but you can't tweak it.
%p The Holy Grail would be starting with direct manipulation of stuff that will generate the code from the direct manipulation.
%p Sketch-n-Sketch is an academic attempt to build a language from direct manipulation.
%p The web app lets you draw things and the code is auto-generated. You can then manipulate either the code or the drawing program.

%p This is a cool tool. There is an "Abstract" button that makes your drawn images into abstracted functions.
%p This is huge. There is a lot of great work that could be done in Software Engineering research about the intersection of direct manipulation and programming.
%p They started with a simple lambda-calculus-based language, and mapped direct manipulation onto the language.
%p Ideally we want the language that is translated to is a production-level language, like JavaScript. We are not there yet, though.
%p We want to be able to build programs by typing less, and building more!!!
%p Thank you, Ravi, for such an amazing demo!!!

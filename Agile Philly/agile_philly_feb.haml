%h2 FitNesse and Selenium
%i Chris Deephouse
%p Do it right the first time. Testing helps move this forward.
%p When there is limited time for testing, so the goal is NO emergency releases.
%p FitNesse is similar to Cucumber in the sense that it helps you write your tests in a more readable way.
%p FitNesse fixtures are similar to Cucumber step definitions.
%p Why not use QTP?
%ul
  %li QTP Client is required for development.
  %li Need to learn VB script.
  %li $10,000 per tester license.
  %li Very poor tech support.
%p Why FitNesse/Selenium instead?
%ul
  %li Uses Firefox, Eclipse, and Spring Source to develop
  %li Wiki-like specifications for tests. Uses Java to develop fixtures.
  %li It is free. :D
  %li The open source community is very helpful.
%p The FitNesse server looks exactly like a wiki.
%p FitNesse tests look like tables in the wiki. Column headers that end with () or ? are assertions, where other columns are for setup.
%p I like how FitNesse makes it easy to edit tests online, since it is just a wiki. What would be nice is if we could create a way to interact with Cucumber through something as simple as a FitNesse wiki...
%p You run FitNesse tests by clicking a button on the FitNesse server.
%p Another way to run FitNesse tests is through Eclipse, or the command line using a TestRunner class.
%p I think FitNesse is like Cucumber for Java developers. It is powerful, but you have to touch a lot of Java code to get it to function.
%p Much like Cucumber, tests can look either techy or more business-like. It is up to the test writer to create human-readable tests.
%p In your fixtures, the inputs are public Strings in your fixture class, which extends ColumnFixture.
%p Assertions are public functions in your fixture class.
%h3 Selenium/FitNesse Bridge
%p Selenium allows you to create tests by just clicking around and then copying and pasting the test that is generated by your clicks. Much like QTP.
%p It allows you to save your tests in a number of formats, including RSpec, Test::Unit, JavaScript, JUnit, etc.
%p With the Selenium/FitNesse Bridge, the Selenium IDE can now output FitNesse as well!
%p Hopefully Chris and his team will open source their Selenium/FitNesse Bridge soon, so watch for it!
%p Thanks for the great talk!

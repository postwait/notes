notes
=====

Notes I have taken at conferences, user groups and other events. I hope you find them useful!


How to use
==========

Most of these notes are taken in [haml](http://haml.info/ "haml"). To turn them into HTML, you need to install the haml gem:

    gem install haml

Then run the haml tool on the file from the command line. For example:

    haml Agile2014/keynote2.haml

You will now have HTML that you can display on a web page!
